## System Design: Calorie Calculator

### Overview:
The Calorie Calculator is a web application that helps users estimate their daily calorie intake. It takes user input, such as weight, height, age, location, and calculates calories considering local temperature. The application is built using the Flask framework and employs web scraping techniques to fetch temperature data from TimeAndDate.com.

### Architecture:

```
User Browser <-----> Web Server (Flask) <-----> Temperature Scraper
             <-----> Calorie Calculator
             <-----> HTML Templates
             <-----> CSS Stylesheet
```

### Components:

1. **User Browser:**
   - Interacts with the application through a web browser.
   - Sends HTTP requests to the web server.

2. **Web Server (Flask):**
   - Main component handling incoming HTTP requests and routing.
   - Consists of various views defined as MethodViews (HomePage, CaloriesFormPage).
   - Communicates with the Temperature Scraper and Calorie Calculator.
   - Renders HTML templates and provides dynamic data through Jinja2 templating.
   - Manages user input validation and response handling.

3. **Temperature Scraper:**
   - Extracts temperature data from TimeAndDate.com using web scraping.
   - Utilizes Selectorlib to extract temperature information based on predefined XPaths.
   - Returns the scraped temperature to the web server.

4. **Calorie Calculator:**
   - Receives user input (weight, height, age) and temperature.
   - Calculates optimal daily calorie intake using a predefined formula.
   - Returns calculated calorie values to the web server.

5. **HTML Templates:**
   - Define the structure and content of various pages (index, calories_form_page).
   - Rendered by the web server and populated with dynamic data.
   - Incorporate Jinja2 template tags for data insertion.

6. **CSS Stylesheet (main.css):**
   - Contains styles and formatting rules for the application's frontend.
   - Enhances visual appeal and provides a responsive design.

### Data Flow:

1. User accesses the application via a web browser.
2. User interacts with the user interface, providing inputs such as weight, height, age, country, and city.
3. The web server (Flask) receives the user's input and processes the request.
4. The Temperature Scraper fetches the current local temperature data from TimeAndDate.com.
5. The Calorie Calculator calculates the optimal daily calorie intake based on user inputs and temperature.
6. The calculated calorie value is returned to the web server.
7. The web server renders the appropriate HTML template with dynamic data.
8. The rendered page is sent to the user's browser for display.

### Technologies Used:

- **Backend:** Flask, Python
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Jinja2 (templating)
- **Web Scraping:** Selectorlib, Requests library

### Deployment and Scaling:

- The application can be hosted on various web hosting platforms, cloud servers, or containerized environments.
- For scalability, consider load balancing and optimizing the application for handling multiple concurrent users.

This system design provides an overview of the architecture and data flow within the **Calorie Calculator** application. It outlines the key components, their interactions, and the technologies used to build the application.
